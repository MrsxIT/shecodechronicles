My aim for this repository is to allow you to get to know the 'she' behind the 'code'. I hope you enjoy reading (& hopefully learning!) along with me.

## Chapter One

This is where the journey begins! Currently I am a complete newbie to this and am still learning how to even use Git. I have created a couple of respositories so far and have started to think about where my learning journey will start and where I want to end up. I work in data management and analysis and am studying towards my business degree, so for me I intend to learn more about coding and programming so that I can consider creating my own applications and pulling data into my applications to be able to better analyse it. (One day, maybe..)
I have been using Virtual Studio Code to edit my respositories, but am also learning how to edit them on Git so that I can practice pulling the files from Git to VS Code and pushing them back out to Git when I have finished editing. I have started to be able to move around my active directory indepdantly using commans make me feel like a real-life coder superhero! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Welcome to my journey and feel free to look around my repositories!

## Chapter Two

I have been doing some practicing on html to get me started and to try and understand how syntax works, I have got to a point where I can use html to format a very basic webpage but still have a lot to learn as well as getting used to CSS.
This was my first project, which I completed by doing an introduction course through Code Academy!

I still have a long way to go as this is a very simple example of what can be done with html, so I am going to explore html further and make sure I fully understand and can use this without needing to ask questions or refer back to anything and then I intend on learning some CSS too!
