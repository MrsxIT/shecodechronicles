## Chapter One

This is where the journey begins! Currently I am a complete newbie to this and am still learning how to even use Git. I have created a couple of respositories so far and have started to think about where my learning journey will start and where I want to end up. I work in data management and analysis and am studying towards my business degree, so for me I intend to learn more about coding and programming so that I can consider creating my own applications and pulling data into my applications to be able to better analyse it. (One day, maybe..)
I have been using Virtual Studio Code to edit my respositories, but am also learning how to edit them on Git so that I can practice pulling the files from Git to VS Code and pushing them back out to Git when I have finished editing. I have started to be able to move around my active directory indepdantly using commans make me feel like a real-life coder superhero! 🦸‍♀️
